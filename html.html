                            Happy Father's Day, Daddy! I hope you have a wonderful day filled with love. You're not perfect, you have your own flaws but you certainly done an amazing job being my father. I promise to do my best in school and make you and mommy proud! I will do my best to improve in school so that I can get my own McLaren. I love you so much, Daddy! I hope your restaurant thrives so that we can buy a car and visit other places and countries.
